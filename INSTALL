proxymin - INSTALL
=================


* You will need:
  --------------

- Python version 2.3.3 or later
  http://www.python.org

- a recent version of the Squid Web Proxy Cache
  http://www.squid-cache.org/

- a recent version of sudo
  http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/
  
- apache 1.3.x or later
  http://www.apache.org/httpd.html



* Installation
  ------------

  1. install python, squid, apache and sudo.

  2. make sure apache is up and running properly.

  3. make sure squid is up and running properly. Test carefully if you can
     use the proxy from a client browser before you proceed.

  4. configure sudo: your CGI user must be allowed to restart squid after
     the configuration has been changed. As the www/cgi user has not root
     privileges we use sudo to selectively allow this user to restart squid as
     needed. Have a look into your apache config to find out as which UID your
     CGIs run (here it is user www but ymmv).
     Now use visudo to allow the CGI user to restart squid. 
     For starters: a line like the following might do the trick but make sure
     you know what you are doing ...
     =========================<snip>=========================
     www	ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/squid
     =========================<snap>=========================

  5. create an empty password file and make sure your CGI user has read/write
     permissions on this file (e.g. /usr/local/etc/squid/passwd).

  6. create a squid configuration template: proxymin is only responsible for
     user management and permissions (ACLs in squid language). So the big 
     majority of the squid configuration (like cache configuation, logging etc.) 
     has nothing to do with proxymin. Have a look at your squid.conf and create
     a "configuration template". This is nothing more than a normal squid.conf 
     file that does not include ACL configuration as that will be append later
     by proxymin. You can find a (very short, probably too short!) example for a
     squid.conf template in the proxymin distribution. The auth_param basic program
     path in the template must be adjusted to fit your setup.
     Now put this template somewhere for later usage 
     (e.g. /usr/local/etc/squid/squid.conf.template).
 
  7. now install proxymin somewhere in your apache CGI directory (here this is 
     /usr/local/www/cgi-bin). Make sure the path/to/python is correct for your
     os in the first line of proxymin.py and images.py.
     Also remember to set the file/directory permissions so that they can be 
     executed by your webserver (755 might be a good choice).
    

  8. open proxymin.conf and adjust the parameters as necessary.
     - squid_cfg: the squid.conf file (main squid configuration). Your CGI user must 
       have write permissions for this file.
     - static_cfg: path to the squid configuration template you created in (6)
     - htpasswd_file: the squid password file you created in (5)
     - squid_reconfigure_command: the correct paths to sudo and squid

  9. open proxymin.py in your browser and have fun administrating your proxy :)

 NOTE: 
     If you want to import existing users then htpasswd_import.py is for you. Make sure 
     proxymin is running correctly before you proceed.
     Open htpasswd_import.py and set PASSWD_SOURCE to the path of your existing password 
     file.
     Furthermore set GROUP to a valid group ID you already created in proxymin.
     Now execute "python htpasswd_import.py".
     Your users should now be available in proxymin. Adjust the group (all are member of
     the group you specified), description etc.
